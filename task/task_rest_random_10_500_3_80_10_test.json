[MASK] T at Metro said she took 3 xrays and trachea was fine Baba was fine until she took the meds Although she died smiling at me while I was eauthenized her Broke my heart I have never sued anybody and don't ever want to I am a recovering alcoholic and I don't need this drama I have to stop this guy About fifteen years ago one of his vets said something really racist I think it was the vet that murdered his wife and unborn child If I do wind up sueing Lukof witch Is last option I will try to have him supeonade Lukof is one heartless individual and if I ran into him somewhere I'm not sure what I would do and I don't believe in violence But that man is evil I can attest to it I went to Alpha vet and [MASK] Lattuda spent an hour and then called me 3 days later and reviewed the health of

a vet She really cares when Carpenter at Harleysville gave me the choice to put Oggy down because of diabetes I just said Ill do my best Fast forward about 14 months and he's fine and harleysville vet appears to be a racist company Have you ever seen any race except white workers or patience With everything the way it is now I think we all need a fair shake That vet 15 years or so ago said they don't pay I was a bit taken back but I had a few pets and they were convenient I'm ashamed of myself now for my failing I know mistakes are made God knows I've made mine But the world I'm from you cover them Not just ignore them especially when Hawkins called and apologized and said Quote I will run reimbursement up the ladder But there is no ladder and when I call they just hang up I can only assume that comes from the top I promise Lukof will pay me plus costs incurred I do wish them the best but if Lukof would take gravely I'll I would just believe he's getting his medicine and wouldn't be heart broke His establishment killed my Baba and that will not go unpaid If I have to I will ruin that practice I have people That idiot has no idea of things legally I have means to do By the way

Janet .. and Chrissy at the next table over coming up with a plan to get Mr Roper his Rent Money and to see Larry up at The Bar hitting on all the Bartenders/Waitresses .. second bad reaction was when I saw the voluminous Craft Beer Selection was mostly nationally distributed stuff from all over the country...that might have been acceptable 3-4 years ago, but why these days when you are located in one of the best craft beer cities and states would your beer menu not mainly be Tampa and Florida Centric? .. third bad reaction was when I saw there was no waitress service and you had to order your food from the bartender and then they bring it out to you...that kind of system may work for Smashburger .. Newks .. Panera .. etc, but when your serving quality food this just cheapens and makes the whole process a nuisance especially when the bar area is crowded .. having said all the above the two food dishes we ordered were fantastic...The Drunken Grilled Cheese had two kinds of cheese and carmelized onions on Sourdough Bread and came with a stellar Blackberry Mead Dipping Sauce...we also [MASK] the wonderful Coconut Curry Goat Tacos which had goat meat with crema .. salsa .. and cilantro inside Flour Tortillas ..
